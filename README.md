# Comment-Toxicity-Detection
The code preprocesses the dataset, builds a sequential model with multiple layers, and trains it on the data. Evaluation metrics gauge the model's performance. After training, the model is saved and loaded for deployment, enabling users to input comments and obtain real-time toxicity predictions through a user-friendly interface.
